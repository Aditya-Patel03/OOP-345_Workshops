In this Workshop, I have learned how to design and code a class template and template a class variable.
I also learned how to specialize a templated class variable for a particular type and how to instantiate 
a template class and further how to specialize member function of a templated class to process a particular type
and deriving a templated class from another templated class.

 This workshop was difficult to do. In fact I submitted until the last minute as I still had some debugging errors.
I always complete the workshop a day before but submit it an hour before its due, but I had to literally complete it at last minute.
I didn't even got the time to properly write the reflect.
