I am not quite sure what to write in the reflecting part as I won't get any response from you within a week. Having said that, In this Workshop, I
have learned how to count the number of records in a text file, and how to monitor time spent on a particular task using "std::chrono". In addition
to this, I also acquired the knowledge of how to copy and move semantics for a class with a resource. Further more, retrieving records from the text 
file using an input file stream object was also a vital part that I learned in this workshop. I am still skeptical about what this part teaches us anything. 
Putting that aside can you provide suggestions as to how I can improvise in this workshop.
