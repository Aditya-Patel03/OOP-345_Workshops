//I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

In this workshop, I have learned how to manage polymorphic objects using the vector container of STL
and how to move dynamically allocated objects in a container. In addition to this I learned how to write a code of range based iterationon objects in a container 
    
	Q1: Why do you need to deallocate the dynamically allocated memory in your vector of resources?
	A:  You can let memory leaks accumulate until your program ends and the OS reclaims the memory for you. 
	
	Q2: To call specific functions for a Directory objects stored in a Resource*, what special C++ operation did you have to do and why?
    A:  
    Q3: In this workshop you had to use std::vector<sdds::Resource*> to store a collection of filesystem resources as pointers. Could you have used std::vector<sdds::Resource> instead? Justify your answer!
    A:  
	
	
	Professor, I am relly not able to complete the reflect file as I don't know how to specifically write it. hence it would be great if you could provide an example for.
