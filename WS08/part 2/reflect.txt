In this workshop I learnt how to use a smart pointer and how to create program component of quadratic complexity.



1.    the advantage that smart pointer syntax provides. Use example from your code to support your explanation.
A:    I used unique pointer.Hence, I can't provide an example of smart pointer application in my code
the use of unique pointer is in WritingRecord.cpp line#46: std::unique_ptr<EmployeeWage> temp(new EmployeeWage(emp[i].name, sal[j].salary));
                    
--Smart pointers bring an improvement to a pointer-driven code by attaching resource ownership information to variables.
					

2.    the difference between raw and smart pointer syntax in your solution.

Raw pointer:  EmployeeWage* temp = new EmployeeWage(emp[i].name, sal[j].salary);
Smart pointer:  std::unique_ptr<EmployeeWage> temp(new EmployeeWage(emp[i].name, sal[j].salary));
