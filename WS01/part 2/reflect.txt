   In this Workshop, I have learnt how to upgrade my code in accordance to accept and manage user defined string regardless of its length.
In addition to this, I have demonstrated my abilities to declare local variables residing in memory throughout the program lifetime,
 receiving program agruments from command line and accessing a variable defined in a different translation unit.
 
    The difficult part for me was the DIY part itself as I find it difficult to upgrade my FoodOrders class in the null terminated string in C-style.
I used the "#ifndef" guard as I used it more than the"#pragma once" guard. The most difficult part of the workshop for me in this workshop was to get 
the display right. And the reflection was also a tough part to do. Hence can you provide a good reflection so that I can improvise on this.
